                <h1>What poses a <span>THREAT</span> to these endangered animals?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are many threats that fuel the extinction of animals, some of these are:<br>
                </p>
                    <h2>HABITAT DESTRUCTION:</h2> 
                    <p>
                        Deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture lead to the loss of natural habitats. Habitat destruction is one of the most<br>
                         significant threats to wildlife, as it directly eliminates the places where animals live, breed, and find food. <br>
                         Deforestation, driven by logging, agriculture, and development, removes vast tracts of forests, which are home to countless species.<br>
                          Urbanization encroaches on natural areas, replacing them with cities, roads, and infrastructure.<br>
                           Agricultural expansion often involves clearing land for crops and livestock, leading to habitat fragmentation,<br>
                            which isolates animal populations and makes it difficult for them to find mates and resources.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                    <h2>CLIMATE CHANGE & POLLUTION:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Changes in climate can alter habitats and make them unsuitable for certain species. Climate change, driven by the<br>
                         accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leads to global temperature increases, changing precipitation patterns,<br>
                         and more frequent extreme weather events. These changes can alter habitats in several ways: rising temperatures may<br>
                          push species out of their thermal tolerance zones, melting ice caps reduce the habitat available for polar species,<br>
                          and shifting weather patterns can affect the availability of food and water.<br>
                          Contaminants in air, water, and soil can harm wildlife. Pollution takes many forms, including chemical pollutants,<br>
                           plastics, and noise pollution. Chemical pollutants, such as pesticides, heavy metals, and industrial chemicals,<br>
                          can poison wildlife, disrupt endocrine systems, and cause reproductive failures. <br>
                           Water pollution from agricultural runoff, sewage, and industrial discharges can create dead zones in aquatic environments,<br>
                           where oxygen levels are too low to support most life forms.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                    <h2>POACHING AND ILLEGAL TRADES:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many species are threatened by illegal hunting and trade. Poaching, the illegal killing of wildlife, is a major threat to many endangered species.<br>
                         Animals are often hunted for their valuable parts, such as elephant tusks, rhino horns, tiger bones, and pangolin scales,<br>
                          which are used in traditional medicine, ornaments, and as status symbols. The illegal wildlife trade is a multi-billion-dollar industry<br>
                           that operates globally, driving many species to the brink of extinction. Poaching disrupts population dynamics, reduces genetic diversity,<br>
                            and can lead to the collapse of populations.
