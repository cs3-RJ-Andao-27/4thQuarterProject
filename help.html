                    Doing these task all alone is not an easy job, thus we need your help:<br>

                    <h2>SUPPORT CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION</h2> 
                    <p>
                        Donate to or volunteer with organizations dedicated to wildlife conservation. Conservation organizations play a crucial role<br>
                         in protecting endangered species and their habitats through a range of activities, including habitat preservation,<br>
                          anti-poaching efforts, research, education, and policy advocacy. Financial donations help these organizations fund their projects,<br>
                           hire staff, and purchase necessary equipment.
                    </p>

                    <h2>MAKE SUSTAINABLE CHOICES</h2>
                    <p>
                        Reduce your ecological footprint by consuming less, recycling, and supporting sustainable products. Individual choices can collectively<br>
                         have a significant impact on the environment. By reducing consumption and waste, recycling materials, and choosing products<br>
                          that are sustainably sourced, you can help lessen the demand for resources that lead to habitat destruction and pollution.<br>
                           For example, choosing certified sustainable seafood helps protect marine ecosystems, while buying products made from recycled<br>
                            materials reduces the need for raw materials.

                    <h2>EDUCATE OTHERS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Spread awareness about the importance of conserving wildlife and what individuals can do to help. Education is a powerful tool<br>
                         for fostering a culture of conservation. By sharing information about the threats to wildlife and the steps people can take to mitigate<br>
                          these threats, you can inspire others to take action. This can be done through various channels, including social media, community events,<br>
                           educational programs, and personal conversations.

                    <h3>TOGETHER</h3>
                    <p>
                        Together with your help, we are able to protect these endangered animals from any more risks. When we think about it, most the causes of their<br>
                         extinctions was because of us. And the sad part of all this, is that we have everything in our capabilities to stop harming them and their habitats.<br>
                         Thus it is only morally right of us to take part all together and work in the preservation of these endangered animals and their habitats.
